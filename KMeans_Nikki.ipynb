    "Outbrain is looking to predict which ad in a given display will be clicked by a user. They have provided an extensive amount of information about where an ad is displayed, what the ad is displaying, and user activity on multiple publisher sites in the United States between 14-June-2016 and 28-June-2016. Based on this information, we are asked to order by decending probability which ad within a display a user will click. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to approach this problem in a step-wise process. First, we will explore the data to better understand what information has been provided. Based on our initial investigation, we will transform the data to fit with the machine learning models we expect to be most appropriate for predicting clicks. If we find potential value in multiple models, we will quickly score a trained model on development data to determine which model we should focus on for optimization. Once a final model is chosen, we will further refine the model and judiciously score against the development model. Our final score will be determined by testing against a provided test dataset (clicks_test) and by the score judged via Kaggle.\n",

Apparently Outbrain either doesn't fully know what is in each document_id or they judge a document is mostly defined by one aspect but has influences of another. As an example: if a document talks about Brad Pitt and refers to his ex-wife as Angelina, we can say the document is 80% about Brad Pitt and 20% about Angelina. Or, alternatively, they are 80% sure the words _Brad Pitt_ refers to the person Brad Pitt and 20% sure the words _Angelina_ refers to the person Angelina Jole.

Every document has a confidence level for one or more items in the vocabulary, so we create a sparse matrix with every topic and category as columns, and every document has a confidence level value in the respective columns.
